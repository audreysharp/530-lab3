Locking protocol
- Each node has its own lock

Delete
- Goal is to lock the trie from root all the way to the node to be deleted
- lock the root node on calling _delete()
- before each recursion into the children, get the lock for the child node
- on each return unlock the current node

Search & insert
- Implement hand over hand locking
- lock root node on calling _search() and _insert()
- before entering recursion, lock the child node and release the parent node
- when the final node is reached, do the insertion, release the parent lock and return
